“New York New York” that’s all that popped in my head as I was coding through the Sinatra project. The project was somewhat challenging in terms of the multiple layers that it contains. This project for me was about planning and thinking like a coder; what do I mean by that? 

This is the first time that I was about to write code in a multilayer file where going back and forth might just give you a headache. I have listened to a lot of programmers and one thing that they have in common is that they spend a lot of time planning rather than coding. I found that to be true for me during this project. Here are my top tips on how to prepare for this project to successfully get the job done. 

Write your project down: 

Writing your project down helped me map the starting point and the direction I was taking. I draw my tables and associations on paper and I imagined how my database should look. Taking that step was super helpful to code efficiently and to get the task done.  

2. Create directories and files as you go:

For a beginner, such as me,  creating all the files at once seems counterintuitive and ungrounding. Instead, creating files as I go makes the job much easier because it allowed for me to focus on one thing at a time. For example, I started coding in my database directory where I created all my tables. Once I had that set up, I asked myself the question, what is the most organic next move that I could be working on? The answer was, I need to create some models and set up my associations as I pretty much drew in the previous tip. As I went through the project, I found myself moving at ease as I worked to solve to next problem. 

3. Crusty CRUD:

Sounds disgusting? It is. This part of project was challenging in terms of its back and forth mechanics. The thinking process around this area became somewhat natural as I was going through it. For creating a new thing, whatever that might be (shirt, blogpost, recipe, etc …), a Get method will upload a form that I will be rendering in the views folder and the post method will show me the result. Every part of CRUD works exactly the same. Client send to server and server reply back to client. As I started debugging my application, tackling one task at a time helped me keep focus to move through the project with confidence. 

Lastly, I felt that this project created a good foundation for me to move confidently to tackle Rails. Hope you found these tips helpful and know patience is key to keep digging through this journey.
