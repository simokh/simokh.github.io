Some of the key concepts in Procedural Rub are: 

* Variables

A variable is way to store values. Each variable takes a distinctive name.  Variables in Ruby can contain different values and different types of values over time. 


* Methods

Ruby methods are used to package one or more repeatable statements into one method. 
Ruby is letter case sensitive. Methods should always be lowere case, otherwise, if you you begin your method with an uppercase letter, Ruby will consider that method a constant; that method will not be executable.

Example 

def dog_name 
	code or expression 
end 

* Arrays

Arrays in ruby are interesting because it is an ensemble of elements that are ordered by indexes. The first index that indicates the first element in the array is [0]. 
Arrays in Ruby can be an integer, string, number and other elements perhaps that I have not yet been exposed to thus far. 

* Iterations

Iterations are another type of method, however, they are supported by arrays and hashes. Iterations will return all the elements of an array or hash by looking at each element. 

Example executing elements in a array:  

array.each do |var|
     code 
end
