I have a background in finance and I am part of a wealth management team. As I am growing professionally, I want to acquire a skill that is becoming essential in the financial space. In college, I was disappointed that a double major in finance and computer science was not offered. Pots graduation, I started exploring coding via whatâ€™s available on the internet. 

In my career, I am realizing the importance of coding within the financial industry. Fintech is the future and I want to be part of the generation who contributes to it. There are so many problems within the traditional banking system that only technology is able to facilitate. 

The company I work for acquired a technology company to help improve the interaction between the company/advisors and clients. Many banking institutions are playing catch up and need a lot of help. Also, there are a lot of startups in the space that are working to reshape the financial arena. 

Through coding, I believe that I am acquiring a skill that will help me grow and be an asset to whomever I am working for in the future.
