How can I get good at coding? It is a question that I have been asking myself since the beginning of the coding journey- which is not long. At the end of the first module of the coding program, we were asked to create a ruby gem. The first thing that occurred to me was anxiety. I am sure a lot of newbies feel the same way. You never coded before, your brain is not wired like the other and the list goes on forever. Here is one of the most important skills that I found very helpful while I am in the beginning of my coding journey. 

You know when you are doing your assignment at your program and all the callable methods are written in the specs file? You do not see them often but we are bound by them to complete the assignment. At first, although, I understand the logic of written methods, I was trying to code and pass the assignments and move on. However, that methodology was causing me so much trouble because I did not understand how the methods were executed nor how things were working together.  

Some of you may say, “Simo use pry.” Yes, pry is very helpful in testing your code, but it is not very helpful when you do not know what is going on. I needed to be on pace and quick, so I started using either irb or replit to actually practice calling methods and classes. I started to create objects and calling methods on those objects to see how they behave. Beyond looking at iterations and other logic functionality, understanding of what is happening and how things are flowing is super helpful in constructing your plan to write your code. Getting stuck is inevitable, but knowing what is going on is key to keep your focus on what needs to be done. 

Repetition may be tedious to some, but learning a language, whether a spoken or coding language, will become easier with repetition. I used repetition during the built of my first Cli ruby gem. I would call Api.method_name in pry console to see the data and I will check the @@all array constantly to make sure I am working with correct data. I would create an object: “project1 = Cli.new” then call that object on methods “project1.method_name” to test my code. You can definitely use pry; however, repeating that process made me understand the flow of my code especially when it becomes very hectic as we write multiple methods. Yes, I did that on purpose to strengthen my knowledge. 

With repetition and completing more examples, confidence will rise and coding will become much more fun!
